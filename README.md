# TaskManager with React State
This was an assignment for my Web Applications Development class. The objective: "Learn to update objects in React state using the spread syntax in a non-form context by building a simple task manager application".

# Maintaining Immutability
In order to retain state immutability for this project, no direct manipulation of the state took place. setTasks and setNextId manipulated their respective values but never touched what was initially sent to the values in the first place.
